    "Lasso Regression, short for Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, is a regularization technique used in regression analysis to prevent overfitting and perform feature selection by shrinking some coefficients to zero. Here's how Lasso Regression differs from other regression techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression: In addition to minimizing the sum of squared residuals like ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, Lasso adds a penalty term that is the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients (L1 regularization).\n",
    "Difference: Lasso's penalty term encourages sparsity in the model by driving some coefficients to exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection.\n",
    "Feature Selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression: Lasso can effectively select the most relevant features by setting the coefficients of less important features to zero, leading to a simpler and more interpretable model.\n",
    "Difference: Unlike Ridge Regression, which shrinks coefficients towards zero but not exactly to zero, Lasso can perform automatic feature selection by eliminating irrelevant predictors.\n",
    "Solution Path:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression: Lasso may yield a sparse solution path, where coefficients drop to zero more abruptly as the penalty term increases, making it useful for models with a large number of predictors.\n",
    "Difference: Ridge Regression tends to shrink coefficients smoothly towards zero, while Lasso can quickly eliminate certain coefficients.\n",
    "Handling Multicollinearity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression: Lasso can handle multicollinearity by selecting one variable from a group of highly correlated variables and setting others to zero.\n",
    "Difference: Ridge Regression is better suited for situations with high multicollinearity, as it shrinks coefficients without eliminating them completely.\n",
    "Suitability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression: Lasso is particularly useful when dealing with high-dimensional datasets, where feature selection and model interpretability are essential.\n",
    "Difference: Ridge Regression may be preferred when multicollinearity is a concern, and a smoother regularization path is desirable."
